    <h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>

    <h2>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</h2>

    <h3>The Llama</h3>

    <p>Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like
        sweets,
        licking her lips as she goes.</p>

    <h3>The Anaconda</h3>

    <p>The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his
        prey.</p>


    <h1>Looking at lists</h1>

    <p>Turn the following list of my favorite vegetables into an unordered list.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Cucumber</li>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
        <li>Asparagus</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Turn the following directions into an ordered list.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>First knock on the door</li>
        <li>When prompted, say the magic word</li>
        <li>Wait for at least 5 seconds</li>
        <li>Turn the handle and push</li>
    </ol>


    <h1>Emphasis and importance</h1>

    <p>There are two things I care about â€” <em>music</em> and <em>friends</em>. Someday I might be able to get <strong>my</strong>
        friends interested in
        each other, and my music!</p>
